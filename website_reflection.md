# Website Reflection Prompt
#Tanaka Chingonzo

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

When I started working on my website, I initially intended for it to be a single page site that would act a single directory to a blog I had already built with Jekyll and was hosting on GitHub pages. I built the single page site with links to all of my social networking profiles and guest blogs. I soon realized that building that one page site had not sufficiently challenged me, and I set out to rebuild my blog to use other features of Jekyll and Ruby I had not used before. I built this new site to act as my digital resume and a portfolio for my work.

I made decisions about theme I would use based on design, the visibility of my bio, contact information and summary. I chose a dual column theme that had a static column to the right that constantly shows my profile to the viewer so that they can always refer to it for context throughout their experience on the website.

I faced particular challenges in using and modifying different Jekyll layouts for the different site pages. Modifying the designs of each page was also initially challenging because it utilized multiple technologies that were unfamiliar to me initially; Liquid text, XML, and Ruby. I challenged myself to figure out how they all worked together, and how I could manipulate the site and its contents.

I took particular pride in how I learnt to install various Gems, which are Jekyll's equivalent of WordPress plugins to carry out functions such as Search Engine Optimization, generating customizable URL slugs and generating meta data and Open Graph markup for rich sharing snippets. I also took pride in how I learnt to customize the blog posts and how they appeared on the blog with or without featured images. Learning to generate and manipulate the keywords cloud for my articles also was a rewarding experience. I enjoyed working with and manipulating this website because it allowed me to work on numerous aspects of web development and design, technologies and frameworks and all of this allowed me to build out my blog, resume, and professional portfolio.

> Thank you for this, Tanaka. I'm glad I asked for this reflection because I really needed to read this to fully understand the work that you'd done. I could tell that you'd switched from the single-pager but it wasn't clear to me what you'd *done* for the assignment: was this just your blog, which you'd already built, that you were showing us? I know now that it *is* your Jekyll site, but that you abandoned the other one-pager so that you could *challenge yourself* by exploring Jekyll and Ruby a little more fully. That's wonderful initiative. Let's chat about where you want to go and how you want to use this project to continue to challenge yourself through the semester. (Oh, and "gems" are kind of like Ruby's "libraries" -- to use python parlance -- so with Jekyll they behave like plugins, but they're the *programming* equivalent to libraries, I think.) ~JAH
